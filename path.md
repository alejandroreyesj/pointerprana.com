Learning to implement a database system from scratch, especially one as complex as PostgreSQL, is a significant undertaking that requires a deep understanding of computer science principles, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering practices. Here's a reasonable path you could follow:

1. **Learn C Programming Language**:

   - Start by learning the basics of C programming language. This will be the foundation for understanding low-level concepts and memory management, which are crucial for building a database system.
   - Recommended resources: K&R's "The C Programming Language", online tutorials, and practice coding exercises.

2. **Study Data Structures and Algorithms**:

   - Gain a solid understanding of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting, and manipulating data.
   - Recommended resources: CLRS's "Introduction to Algorithms", online courses (e.g., Coursera, edX), and practice on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.

3. **Database Concepts and Theory**:

   - Learn about relational database concepts, including tables, rows, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, normalization, and ACID properties.
   - Study database theory, including relational algebra, relational calculus, and SQL.
   - Recommended resources: "Database System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan, online courses (e.g., Stanford's "Introduction to Databases" on Coursera).

4. **Understand Operating Systems**:

   - Gain knowledge about operating system concepts such as processes, threads, memory management, file systems, and concurrency control.
   - Recommended resources: "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne, online courses, and tutorials.

5. **Learn About Storage Systems**:

   - Study how data is stored on disk and memory, as well as techniques for efficient data retrieval and storage.
   - Understand file organization, indexing, and caching mechanisms.
   - Recommended resources: "Database Management Systems" by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke, online courses, and research papers on storage systems.

6. **Build Simple Database Components**:

   - Start by building basic components of a database system, such as a simple storage manager, query parser, and query executor.
   - Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on in-memory data structures.
   - Recommended resources: Tutorials, open-source database projects, and academic papers on database internals.

7. **Gradually Increase Complexity**:

   - Progressively add more features and complexity to your database implementation, such as indexing, transaction management, concurrency control, query optimization, and logging.
   - Study existing database systems like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL to understand their architectures and features.
   - Implement advanced database features one at a time, while ensuring correctness and performance.
   - Experiment with different algorithms and techniques, and analyze their trade-offs.

8. **Study Existing Database Systems**:

   - Dive deep into the architecture and source code of existing database systems like PostgreSQL, understanding how they handle complex features like MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), query optimization, replication, and high availability.
   - Learn from their design decisions, optimizations, and performance improvements.

9. **Continuous Learning and Practice**:
   - Stay updated with the latest advancements in database research and technologies.
   - Continuously refine and optimize your database implementation, incorporating new techniques and best practices.
   - Participate in database-related communities, forums, and conferences to learn from others and share your knowledge.

Remember that building a database system like PostgreSQL is a challenging and time-consuming task that requires patience, dedication, and a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals. Take your time to understand each concept thoroughly and don't hesitate to seek help from experts and resources whenever needed.
